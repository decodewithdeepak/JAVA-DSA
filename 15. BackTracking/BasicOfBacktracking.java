// Backtracking is a technique to solve problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

// Example: Rat in a Maze, N-Queens, Sudoku, Knight's Tour, Word Break, etc.

// Algorithm of recursive backtracking:
// 1. Base case: If the current solution is valid, return the solution.
// 2. Recursive case: Try all possible options for the next decision.
// 3. If the decision leads to a valid solution, return the solution.
// 4. If the decision leads to an invalid solution, backtrack and undo the decision.
// 5. Repeat the above steps until all decisions are made.
